# Shubh's Draw2UI

This app leverages tldraw and the GPT-4 Vision API to transform your wireframe sketches into fully functional HTML with Tailwind styling. It provides an innovative way to rapidly prototype your UI designs by simply drawing them out.

> Note: This version integrates design insights, aiming to improve usability and visual consistency. The inspiration is rooted in a blend of creative design and cutting-edge AI technology.

## How It Works

- Draw your UI wireframe using tldraw.
- The app captures the current canvas as an SVG and converts it to a PNG image.
- The PNG is sent to GPT-4 Vision with instructions to return a single HTML file, styled with Tailwind CSS.
